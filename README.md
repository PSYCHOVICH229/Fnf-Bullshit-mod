# Friday Night Funkin' - Bullshit mod [On psych engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
Original engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## How to compile the mod and [Psych engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)
You must have [Haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5//), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.
